## Description
 

**Experiment**

- 5 subjects x 5 minute resting sessions, eyes open 

**MEG acquisition**

- Recorded at the Montreal Neurological Institute in 2012-2016
- Acquisition with CTF 275 MEG system at 2400Hz sampling rate
- Anti-aliasing low-pass filter at 600Hz, files may be saved with or without the CTF 3rd order gradient compensation
- Recorded channels (at least 297), include:
  * 26 MEG reference sensors (#2-#27)
  * 270 MEG axial gradiometers (#28-#297)
  * 1 ECG bipolar (EEG057/#298) - Not available in the empty room recordings
  * 1 vertical EOG bipolar (EEG058/#299) - Not available in the empty room recordings
  * 1 horizontal EOG bipolar (EEG059/#300) - Not available in the empty room recordings 

**Head shape and fiducial points**

- 3D digitization using a Polhemus Fastrak device driven by Brainstorm. The .pos files contain:
  * The center of the CTF coils
  * The anatomical references we use in Brainstorm: nasion and ears as illustrated here
  * Around 100 head points distributed on the hard parts of the head (no soft tissues). 

**Subject anatomy**

- Structural T1 image (defaced for anonymization purposes)
- Processed with FreeSurfer 5.3
- The anatomical fiducials (NAS, LPA, RPA) have already been marked and saved in the files fiducials.m 


**BIDS**

- The data in this dataset has been organized according to the MEG-BIDS specification (Brain Imaging Data Structure, http://bids.neuroimaging.io) (Niso et al. 2018)
