## Description

**Experiment**
- 5 subjects x 5 minute resting sessions, eyes open 

**MEG acquisition**
- Recorded at the Montreal Neurological Institute in 2012-2016
- Acquisition with CTF 275 MEG system at 2400Hz sampling rate
- Anti-aliasing low-pass filter at 600Hz, files may be saved with or without the CTF 3rd order gradient compensation
- Recorded channels (at least 297)
* 26 MEG reference sensors (#2-#27)
* 270 MEG axial gradiometers (#28-#297)
* 1 ECG bipolar (EEG057/#298) - Not available in the empty room recordings
* 1 vertical EOG bipolar (EEG058/#299) - Not available in the empty room recordings
* 1 horizontal EOG bipolar (EEG059/#300) - Not available in the empty room recordings 
  
**Head shape and fiducial points**
- 3D digitization using a Polhemus Fastrak device driven by Brainstorm. The .pos files contain:
* The center of the CTF coils
* The anatomical references we use in Brainstorm: nasion and ears as illustrated here
* Around 100 head points distributed on the hard parts of the head (no soft tissues). 

**Subject anatomy**
- Structural T1 image (defaced for anonymization purposes)
- Processed with FreeSurfer 5.3
- The anatomical fiducials (NAS, LPA, RPA) have already been marked and saved in the files fiducials.m 

**BIDS**
The data in this dataset has been organized according to the MEG-BIDS specification (Brain Imaging Data Structure, http://bids.neuroimaging.io) (Niso et al. 2018)
